**IMPORTANT: Account name lookup is deprecated in DAWN 3.X and higher. This is only relevant if using DAWN 2.X public testnet!!!!**

## Account Name Lookup

Looks up your account on Testnet if you're in the Genesis file, located [here](https://eosio.github.io/genesis/tools/account-name/index.html)

**Note about Genesis File:** You will only have an account in the testnet Genesis file if you had an EOS ERC20 balance up to and including period 162
