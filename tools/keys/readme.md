```

Install [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) globally

```bash
npm install electron-packager
```

Clone the repo

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/genesis.git
```

Navigate to keys directory

```bash
cd genesis/tools/keys
```

Compile for current platform

```bash

```

You'll now find a **build** directory in the project root, where you can find an executable for your system. 

## Compile for all Platforms

### Building for All Platforms

_If running on a mac, you'll need to install xquartz and wine, easiest is through homebrew_

```bash
npm run compile-all
```
